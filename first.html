    <div class="bbc">    <h3>Jagtar Singh Johal case: UK spy agencies accused of tip-off that led to torture</h3>
        <small><span>  BBC security correspondent   </span> </small>
        <p> UK intelligence agencies are accused of tipping off Indian authorities about a British national before his abduction and alleged torture by Punjab police.
    
        Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, was in India in 2017 when his family say he was forced into an unmarked car.
            
        He says he was then tortured over days, including with electrocution. He has remained in detention since then.
            
        Successive British prime ministers have raised his case but India's government denies he was tortured or mistreated.
            
        Mr Johal was an active blogger and campaigner for Sikh human rights, which are said to have brought him to the attention of the Indian authorities.
            
        In May, he was formally charged with conspiracy to commit murder and being a member of a terrorist gang. He will be presented with a full list of the charges against him next month and faces a possible death penalty. </p>
